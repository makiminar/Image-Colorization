# Image colorization

The goal is to create and implement models that take grayscale images as input and predict colourized images as output. The colourization will focus on art images - paintings, portraits, etc. The framework used for this semestral work is Pytorch.

Some subgoals need to be completed, specifically:

- create an appropriate art dataset,
- desing and implement ML models,
- evaluate the results on testing data.

### Dataset
I downloaded several separate art datasets and then concatenated them into one of 6883 images. The first dataset I downloaded is from \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time}. The author downloaded paintings from the top 50 most influentual artists from artchallenge.ru website. The second dataset I downloaded was from \url{https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/289kxpnp57/1}, which is a collection of of portraits.

### How to run the notebook

You can either download the notebook and run it in your environment, or you can see the work in this Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h6a5Aq2k6MoWAQwJmQmm2ZDA7C76j9WD?pli=1&authuser=5#scrollTo=C1hIENcSQ1Tj. (only for members of the shared disc)
